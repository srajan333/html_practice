        Following Palmer's first win (and expected lunch with then-President
        Dwight D. Eisenhower[1]) with Avery at the 1958 Masters Tournament,
        Palmer's wife Winnie meant to write a check to Avery for the
        then-standard $1,400 caddie fee, but in her haste instead wrote the
        amount as $14,000; Avery unsuccessfully tried to cash the check, calling
        her from Augusta National.[2][6] At the 1960 Masters Tournament, with
        Palmer down at the 15th hole, Avery asked, "Mr. Palmer, are we
        chokin'?"[2] Palmer then shot two birdies on the 17th and 18th to win
        the tournament by a single stroke.[2] Palmer would later remark:
        [Avery's] understanding of what made me tick was perhaps instinctive and
        definitely profound. I stared back at him and realized he was right—I
        was foolishly beating on myself instead of taking care of the business
        of playing the golf course. His scowl was eerily reminiscent of the
        disapproving glare Pap used to give me as a kid whenever I threw a club
        or failed to keep my mind on the job.[1]

        Avery and Palmer's last tournament together was in 1968, and Palmer lost
        touch with Avery over time.[2] In 1969, Avery told the AP, "I was with
        Arnie through four championships and then he let me down."[8] By 1974,
        the AP found Avery "sad" and "lonely" in Augusta,[4] having last worked
        as a caddie in 1971 and only able to find work at the Masters carrying
        equipment for a photographer. Avery told them "no man knows this course
        like me. I know every tree, every blade of grass, every break on the
        greens."[4] Avery also said Palmer was "having his problems. He'll never
        make a comeback until he gets me back, you just watch and see."[4] Avery
        also often spent winters in New York with relatives, and was briefly
        incarcerated in Richmond County Jail.[1][7]

        Nathaniel "Iron Man" Avery (1939 – May 3, 1985[1][2]) was an
        African-American golf caddie at Augusta National Golf Club, famous for
        helping Arnold Palmer win four Masters titles in 1958, 1960, 1962, and
        1964.[2][3] His high public profile and visibility during Palmer's rise
        to fame made Avery one of the first caddies given attention by the
        media.[1]

        Avery was born in Augusta, Georgia, in 1939, the last of his parents'
        eight children.[4][2] His older brother "Big Henry" Avery was caddie
        master at the Augusta Country Club, leading Avery himself to spend time
        at the caddie yard in his early teens.[2] During this time in the early
        1950s, Avery would often boast he could easily carry the heaviest bags,
        first earning him the nickname "Iron Man".[a][2] Avery began caddying
        for then-rookie Arnold Palmer in 1954 at the age of 16 – "Even though
        Ken Venturi was the heat," he would later tell the Augusta
        Chronicle.[1][4][6]
